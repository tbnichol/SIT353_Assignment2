THINGS TO DO

SERVER
Create player object and add it to the relevant vector
Create ship object within room that corresponds to the player
'Start' reciving data from clients
Retransmit the positions of players to the clients

CLIENT
remove ability to read its own server sent data (it'll stay completely still)

DESPERATE CHANGES
ShipNetData related things need to be moved out of the client
We need to write down all our functions and what they do somewhere. Half of these arent probably needed
We need to depricate GameClientSide and GameServerSide completely.
